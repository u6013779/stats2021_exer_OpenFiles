#  Getting Started

## Introduction:
If you're reading this you have successfully installed R and RStudio. Good job!

This assignment is written as an Rmarkdown file and can be used to generate formatted output. One of the advantages of this output is it includes the code with the output. If you ever need to recreate an analysis in the future, it's probably more important to have a record of the code used than the actual output. (Always save your code with your data file(s).)

There are several different output formats available.You can see a list at https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-9.html

We'll be using the output for markdown documents which display nicely on GitHub. You can see the output type specified in the header section of this assignment. (Scroll back to the top to see it.)

## Directions:
Complete each step of the assignment below.

## Install/Load needed packages
Run the following code block to install the R packages needed for this assignment and load them into memory. (This may take a few minutes if you haven't installed the packages before. If you get any errors or warnings, try running the block another time.)
```{r}
# List the packages needed
packages <- c("tidyverse", "rio", "jmv")

# Check if each package is installed already. If not, install the package.
for (i in packages){
  if(! i %in% installed.packages()){
    install.packages(i,dependencies = TRUE)
  }
  # Show each package that is checked.
  print(i)
  
  # Load each package into memory so we can use it.
  library(i,character.only=TRUE)
}
```

## Open a csv data file
CSV files can be opened using the menus in RStudio or by executing code. Open your data file by using the menu (File - Import Dataset) or executing the code block below to open the Week1.csv file. If you use the menus, make sure to select From Text (readr)... We will use Tidyverse packages as much as possible in this class. The readr package is a Tidyverse package. The rio packages tries to make data import and export simple. The following code block uses the rio import() function. When you open the dataset, notice that a new Data object appears in the Environment pane in the top right window of RStudio. (If the Environment pane isn't showing, click on the Environment tab.) You can see the variables in the dataset by clicking on the circle with the triangle in it next to the name of the data object. You can see the data in a spreadsheet like window by clicking on the name of the data object. Click on the tab with this assignment to come back to it after looking at the dataset pane. Try both of them out. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/vignettes/rio.html
library(rio)
csvdataset <- rio::import(file.choose())
```

## Open an Excel workbook
Excel files can be opened using the menus in RStudio or by executing code. Open your data file by using the menu (File - Import Dataset) or executing the code block below to open the Week1.xlsx file. The rio packages tries to make data import and export simple. The following code block uses the rio import() function. When you open the dataset, notice that a new Data object appears in the Environment pane in the top right window of RStudio. (If the Environment pane isn't showing, click on the Environment tab.) You can see the variables in the dataset by clicking on the circle with the triangle in it next to the name of the data object. You can see the data in a spreadsheet like window by clicking on the name of the data object. Click on the tab with this assignment to come back to it after looking at the dataset pane. Try both of them out. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/vignettes/rio.html
library(rio)
xlsdataset <- rio::import(file.choose())
```

## Open an SPSS data file (.sav file)
SPSS data files can be opened using the menus in RStudio or by executing code. Open your data file by using the menu (File - Import Dataset) or executing the code block below to open the Week1.xlsx file. The rio packages tries to make data import and export simple. The following code block uses the rio import() function. When you open the dataset, notice that a new Data object appears in the Environment pane in the top right window of RStudio. (If the Environment pane isn't showing, click on the Environment tab.) You can see the variables in the dataset by clicking on the circle with the triangle in it next to the name of the data object. You can see the data in a spreadsheet like window by clicking on the name of the data object. Click on the tab with this assignment to come back to it after looking at the dataset pane. Try both of them out. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/vignettes/rio.html
library(rio)
savdataset <- rio::import(file.choose())
```

## Datasets in R
R has a number of data set included with it. One of those datasets is the cars dataset. Try executing the code chunk below by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new code chunk below this line by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.
```{r}
print ("hello")
```


## Save your output.
Save this assignment as a markdown file by following these steps:

1. Click the preview or knit button at the top of this window.
    + RStudio will execute each block of code and save the results to create the output. You may need to select each file like you did when you ran the code blocks one at a time.
    + A popup should appear with all the output for the assignment.
    + Or a page should appear in the Viewer pane in the bottom right corner of RStudio.
    + If the button said knit, a new file should appear in the same folder as your .Rmd file with the same name. you can submit that file for your assignment.(You can check that by clicking on the Files tab to see if a new html file is in the folder. Click on the Viewer tab to go back to the output viewer.)
    + If the button said Preview, you probably need to continue on to the next steps.
2. Click the Open in Browser button or Show in New Window button at the top of that window.
    + Your output should open up in your web browser.
3. Save the page in the web browser.
    + Usually you can right click and select save as...
    + Or select save as from the browser menu
    
## Submit your assignment.
Submit the output you just saved for your assignment.
